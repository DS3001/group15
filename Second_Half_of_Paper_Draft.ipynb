    "Graph 10: KDE Plot by Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The above KDE plot displays the density distributions of a variety of socioeconomic classes (notably, lower class, middle class, working class, and upper class) across the period from 1995 to a projected 2025. The key for the graph is as follows: the middle class is denoted by the blue line, the working class is denoted by the orange line, the upper class is denoted by the green line, and the lower class is denoted by the red line. Interestingly, the density distributions of the middle and working classes showcase parallel trends over time. However, their aligned trends are understandable due to the overlapping characteristics and challenges that both groups face. However, it is more striking to see that the lower and upper classes, typically viewed as polar opposites in socioeconomic structures, share parallel trends. The lower and upper classes over the years have had relatively slow growth, only peaking in the years immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The slow growth makes sense due to the barriers preventing the upward mobility of the lower class (i.e., lack of access to affordable healthcare, education, policies that favor their improvement  - as most concentrate on the middle and working class-, outsourcing, etc.) and wealth inequality favoring the upper class (i.e., most individuals possess generational wealth, have policies geared towards them, and/or unpredictability of the financial market, etc.) can impact their wealth but not the number of people in the top 5% or 10% of the population. However, the same reasons can also be used to explain why the lower class has a steeper growth in comparison to the upper class, making it convoluted to pinpoint a particular set of explanations for this trend. Similarly, this sort of juxtaposition can also be seen in the similar peaks both classes possess in the post-pandemic era. There were many individuals, who were predominantly low-wage workers, who lost their jobs due to their employment closing down during the pandemic. Many of them faced difficulties in the post-pandemic era as many businesses were permanently closed or were struggling to accommodate full working capacity. However, there were also some businesses and shareholders that became richer during the pandemic (notably big pharma, healthcare, grocery, zoom, etc.). Predominantly, these individuals and sectors kept a lot of the profits to themselves and barely raised the wages for their low-income workers. Hence, we can use this information to explain why we see simultaneous peaks for both the upper and lower class individuals, yet why the lower class’s peak is higher than the upper class’s peak. \n",

    "The above graphs are the KDE plots that map the density distribution of classes by year but are separated by gender. The key for the women’s graph is as follows: the middle class is denoted by the blue line, the working class is denoted by the orange line, the upper class is denoted by the green line, and the lower class is denoted by the red line. The key for the men’s graph is as follows: the middle class is denoted by the blue line, the working class is denoted by the green line, the upper class is denoted by the orange line, and the lower class is denoted by the red line. Interestingly enough, both men and women pretty much follow the same trends as the general KDE plot we looked at above. However, the male distributions are more spread out for the working class and middle class than the female plot’s distribution (with the female plot having a more closer match with the trends in the general plot). Intriguingly enough, this divide for males spans from 2007 to 2022. This tracks right before the 2008 economic recession to post COVID-19 era, which gives us some insight into wage stagnation, globalization, and faster recovery due to the nature of jobs for middle-class individuals (i.e., IT sectors providing opportunities to transition work into remote settings whereas construction and retail jobs were completely halted) could have exasperated this divide. As males tend to work more in sectors like construction, manual labor, and manufacturing, (domains that were more impacted by the recession and the pandemic) it could explain the higher divide for males than females in the graphs. In addition, there has been a shift in the job market that has allowed for female-dominated fields (i.e., healthcare, education, service, etc.) to have opportunities that promote upward mobility, which could also be the reason for the smaller disparity for them in comparison to the males. \n",
    "\n",
    "An additional interesting finding is that if we use the general graph’s lower-class vs upper-class lines as a median, the disparity between these two classes is higher than the median amongst females and lower than the median amongst males. This could potentially be caused by the wage disparity between males and females (where females, regardless of class, get paid less than males), part-time work, or career breaks more often taken by women for child-rearing purposes (which could further impact their wages and could impact career progression more for lower class females who lack access to resources that upper-class women could have), and other policies that may be more favorable to males than females (i.e., maternity leave, child support, etc.). \n",

    "Graph 13: \n",
    "The above graph plots the density distribution of SATFIN (satisfaction with financial situation) from 1995 to a projected 2025. The key of the graph is as follows: an orange line depicting more or less satisfied, a blue line depicting not at all satisfied, and a green line depicting pretty well satisfied. Overall, there is a higher trend across the years of individuals being more or less satisfied, except for dips in 2003 (post 9/11 era), the period of the 2008 economic recession, and right before the COVID-19 pandemic. This tracks alongside the unfortunate economic circumstances I listed above, making it understandable why the density of individuals may have dropped during those time periods. Yet, it is interesting to see the highest peak of individuals being placidly content with their financial situation (more or less satisfied) right after 2020 (around 2021-2022). From around 2019, after the dip, the density of people being somewhat content with their financial situation was on a steep rise - which is interesting considering the rise in the cost of living everywhere and the terrible inflation plaguing the economy. However when in comparison with the previous graphs (KDE Plots by class), this tracks alongside the rising rates of middle-class and working-class individuals. As, especially middle class individuals, tend to have some breathing room when it comes to finances but not as much compared to the upper class.\n",

    "The above graphs plot the density distribution of SATFIN (satisfaction with financial situation) from 1995 to a projected 2025 but are separated by gender. The key of the male graph is as follows: an orange line depicting more or less satisfied, a blue line depicting not at all satisfied, and a green line depicting pretty well satisfied. The key of the female graph is as follows: an orange line depicting pretty well satisfied, a blue line depicting more or less satisfied, and a green line depicting not at all satisfied. The two graphs tend to follow the same trends as the general graph (graph #13). However, a notable difference between the male and female graphs can be seen in the time period that the 2008 economic recession occurred. The male distribution has a smaller disparity amongst individuals who are not at all satisfied and pretty well satisfied during that time frame than females. While there were more individuals who were not satisfied at all in comparison to individuals who were pretty well satisfied with their financial conditions for both males and females, the female’s graph displayed a longer duration of this disparity (from around 2008 till 2016/17) and a larger distribution variation (the largest variation for females in distribution being 0.04 compared to males which was 0.02). This disparity between the two graphs could, as stated before, be due to the wage disparity between females and males (which could have left women more unstable, with fewer savings, than men), differences in job security and type of employment (where women tend to work more in part-time or temporary roles or in lower ranks than males that are typically cut first during times of economic hardship), and variations in the industries that could have been impacted (more male-dominated industries may have been impacted to less severity than female-dominated industries). \n",

    "The above graph displays the density distribution of FINALTER (changes in financial situation) from 1995 to a projected 2025. The key of this graph is as follows: the blue line depicts financial situation stayed the same, the orange line depicts financial situation got better, and the green line depicts that their financial situation got worse. Interestingly, the trends of better financial situations and stayed the same are closely intertwined. Surprisingly, the financial situations of individuals post-2001 were generally better for a lot of individuals than staying the same (although both were declining till 2004, there was a higher distribution of people who still stated their situation was better). More than fear, it seems like 9/11 didn’t negatively affect people’s financial situation. On the other hand, during the economic recession of 2008, there were way more people who stated their financial situation stayed the same and people who stated their situation worsened than individuals who stated their individuals whose situations got better. This tracks alongside the fact that some industries, like banks, construction, or real estate, were more negatively impacted than other industries that were immune to the situation like healthcare, discount retail, or the public sector. But most surprisingly, during and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic, all three lines hit their maximum peak, with the distribution being the highest for individuals whose financial situation stayed the same.  This could be explained by the spike in the distribution of middle-class and working-class individuals during this time as we saw in graphs #10, 11, 12, and 13. This could also explain why there were a lot more people during this time, as we saw in graph #13, were more individuals who were more or less satisfied with their financial situation. Yet, there were more individuals whose financial situations got better than they got worse. This is perplexing given the other graphs we looked at - the spike for the upper class as seen in graph #10 was very small compared to the rest and not many people were pretty satisfied in their financial situations in graph #13. So if there were also a considerable number of people whose financial situation got better during this time, then how come they weren’t satisfied? Maybe it has to do with their expenditures or emotions during that time more than their actual financial situation.\n",

    "The above graph displays the density distribution of FINALTER (changes in financial situation) from 1995 to a projected 2025 but separated by gender. The key for the two graphs is as follows: the blue line depicts financial situation stayed the same, the orange line depicts financial situation got better, and the green line depicts that their financial situation got worse. These graphs follow the overall trend as graph #16. However, there is only one stark difference: the male distribution shows that there are slightly more individuals whose financial situation got better during the pandemic than stayed the same. This is interesting when in direct comparison with the females’ distribution as there was a larger divide (with a higher proportion) of individuals’ financial situation staying the same and their situation getting better. Again, maybe the job market was more favorable for male-dominated industries than female-dominated industries during that time. Females also tend to make up a larger proportion of the service industry (especially hospitals) and education as their financial situation may have stayed the same compared to other booming industries at the time. Stock market and shareholders typically tend to have more male dominance, which could also be a reason why there could have been more financial changes favoring males than females. \n",

    "Conclusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "After thoroughly analyzing the General Social Survey, our findings have provided some fascinating insights into how people perceive their financial circumstances and their subjective social class placements spanning from 2000 to 2022. First of all, people’s satisfaction and perceived change in their financial situation are predominantly influenced by times of severe economic recession and their socioeconomic status. Analysis of the post 9/11 time period as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, times wherein fear and uncertainty of the future was more widespread amongst all socioeconomic classes than economic hardship, saw a predominant distribution of individuals being more or less satisfied with their financial situation, having stagnant finances, and some even seeing improvement during these times. We noticed that this particular distribution was correlated with a higher concentration of individuals in the middle and working class, in which possessing a moderate financial cushion, access to more resources, and employment in more resilient industries could serve as explanations for this trend. In addition, we observed that gender equally plays a significant role in these trends. We noticed that females tended to experience more pronounced periods of economic hardship than men. Not many women identified themselves as being upper class (although a higher distribution of men did) and even in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, an extremely high distribution of females were only moderately complacent with their financial situation compared to men who felt as if their finances had gotten better and expressed feeling more positive. We also noticed that men tended to bounce back from recessions and economic downfall faster, regardless of class, which could be due to not having as much as child-rearing responsibilities, better types of employment, and being in industries (Information Technology, business, healthcare, etc.) that sought more immunity to times of hardships. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we acknowledge potential shortcomings in our data analysis that may invite criticism. We observed that there was a gender imbalance in the survey participation, leading to more women responding than men. We acknowledge this disparity and made sure to carefully take this into account when we conducted our data wrangling and visualization process. Instead of looking at the mean, we decided to utilize the median for a more unbiased and accurate distribution of our trends. We employed statistical weighting techniques such as constructing KDE plots that are more resistant to such disparities and could present results that are more reflective of the general population. Our findings also align with secondary data sources and independent studies, cited throughout our analysis, that provide reasonable explanations for the trends we have seen (i.e., the inequality in policies regarding maternity leave/child-rearing, the wage disparity between males and females, men’s faster economic recovery following recessions, etc.). We also examined within-gender patterns, comparing men's and women's experiences over time, independently. Alongside this, the General Social Survey has historically tended to have more female responses than male - so casting aside their perspective, which is commonly sidelined or underrepresented in mainstream society, seems unfair given the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we also noticed that in the post-COVID-19 pandemic time frame, financial satisfaction and change in financial situation for all socioeconomic classes and genders significantly decreased (and was projected to decrease until 2025). This seems to contradict that during the height of the pandemic, the distribution of people who felt as if their situations were more or less the same (or even better for males) and were complacent in their situations rapidly increased. As we step forward into shedding the past and moving forward to obtain as much as normality as we can, it seems quite alarming that individuals feel negative and are facing even more economic hardships. While this is out of the scope of our project, as we navigate the post-pandemic world, we feel that a deeper dive into the underlying causes of this sentiment shift is crucial. While our study focused on socioeconomic status and gender, further research should delve into other influential factors such as race, education level, cost of living, healthcare, and employment trends.\n",
