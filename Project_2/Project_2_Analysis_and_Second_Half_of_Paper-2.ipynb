    "Graph 1: Stroke Likelihood by Gender (bar graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bar graph that illustrates the likelihood of stroke by gender. Males are denoted by the color green, and females are denoted by the color orange. On the x-axis, 0 indicates that the individuals have not suffered a stroke in the given time period and 1 indicates that they have experienced a stroke. While the results may be a little biased due to a greater percentage of women who have answered the questionnaire, by a slight amount, there is a greater amount of women than men who have experienced a stroke. Even with the potential bias, this finding tracks alongside the CDC’s and other esteemed research publications that women do experience strokes more often than men. This could be due to a lot of other factors such as women tending to live longer than men (which increases the likelihood of them having a stroke), having greater risk during pregnancy (e.g., higher blood pressure tends to cause a higher risk of stroke), utilizing certain birth control medications, etc. However, it is interesting to note that the sampled population has a significantly higher count of both women and men who have not experienced a stroke than those who have. This could be due to maybe having generally more physically healthy individuals or maybe sampling from a younger population (as usually, people over the age of 55 have a higher probability of getting a stroke than others). \n",

    "Graph 2: KDE Plot by Age \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a KDE plot that showcases the distribution of the ages of the individuals separated by gender. Females are denoted by the orange line and males are denoted by the green line. As discussed above, there is an overall trend in which there is a greater distribution of females than males. Interestingly, for females, there is a larger distribution in the age range 20 to 65, whereas for males there is a larger distribution of individuals in the age range 40 to 70. The greater variability in the age range could be a reason for why in graph 1 there were a larger number of individuals who did not experience a stroke in the time period than those who did. There is a higher distribution of females greater than 55 than males, which could also contribute to the higher number of females experiencing strokes seen in Graph 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph 3: KDE Plot by glucose level\n",
    "This is a KDE plot that showcases the distribution of the average glucose level of the individuals separated by gender. Females are denoted by the orange line and males are denoted by the blue line. Intriguingly, there is a larger distribution of individuals within the normal range of average glucose level (70 mg/dl to 126 mg/dl) than those who are at risk and are way above it. This again supports the analysis found in Graph 1, as the reasoning for there being a significantly higher count of women and men who have not experienced a stroke within the time period could be partly because there is a higher distribution of physically healthy individuals as explained by the higher distribution of those in the normal range of average glucose level. Both females and males also see a spike around the 200 mg/dl average glucose level, in which females have a slightly larger distribution than males.  The elevated average glucose level along with the smaller distribution of individuals who have it could track alongside the individuals who experienced a stroke in Graph 1. \n",

    "\n",
    "Graph 4: \n",
    "This is a KDE plot that showcases the distribution of the body mass index of the individuals separated by gender. Females are denoted by the orange line and males are denoted by the blue line. Generally, there seems to be a higher concentration of individuals who have a healthy body mass index for both men and women. Women’s highest peak in this graph falls around 20 to 30, which tracks within the normal weight classification for women (with the numbers nearing 30 on the edge of being classified as overweight, which is the tail-end portion of this peak). However, men’s highest peak in this graph falls around 25 to 35, which falls around the range of overweight to slightly obese in the normal weight classification for men. This could be explained by the trend we saw in Graph 2 where there was a larger distribution of older men (40 to 70) than there were women (who were more spread out). Typically, individuals who are between the ages of 51 to 69 tend to be more overweight/obese than their other range counterparts. With there being a higher distribution of men in that age range, this could explain why men have a higher concentration of individuals who are slightly obese/overweight category. Yet, it is interesting to note that despite there being a higher concentration of men who are like this, they maintained a healthier concentration of the average glucose level and still lesser in count than women who experienced a stroke in this timeframe.\n",

    "Graph 5: \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a box plot that plotted the age distribution of the individuals who experienced or did not experience a stroke. On the x-axis, 0 indicates that the individuals have not suffered a stroke in the given time period and 1 indicates that they have experienced a stroke. The average age of individuals who suffered a stroke in this time period was around 70 and had a way smaller yet more aged range of individuals than the boxplot of those who did not suffer a stroke (in which the median age was around 42 and the range was from 0 to 82). The median age of those who experienced a stroke tracks alongside the typical age of those who suffer it (as discussed before in graph 1, above the age of 55, the probability of receiving a stroke doubles). The smaller yet higher age range of individuals in those who experienced the stroke also tracks alongside the fact that older individuals typically are more susceptible to having a stroke than their younger counterparts. Interestingly, there is one outlier for the boxplot of those who experienced a stroke, in which their age is less than 20 years old. While this does not affect the above analysis, it is quite intriguing that someone that young suffered a stroke.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Graph 6:\n",
    "This is a box plot that plotted the body mass index distribution of the individuals who experienced or did not experience a stroke. On the x-axis, 0 indicates that the individuals have not suffered a stroke in the given time period and 1 indicates that they have experienced a stroke. Overall, the range of the BMI of those who experienced a stroke is less than the range of the BMI of those who did not. This tracks alongside the observations we have made that there is more variability amongst those who have not experienced a stroke than those who have (as typically a similar demographic of individuals are usually more susceptible to experiencing a stroke). However notably, the boxplot of those who have experienced a stroke have a median BMI around 30. As talked about in graph 4, typically individuals who have a BMI of 30 tend to only be slightly overweight. While this should only slightly elevate their risk of having a stroke, coupled with our findings in Graphs 1 and 5, it seems like there is a higher proportion of individuals who are above the age of 55, which then drastically increases their likelihood of experiencing a stroke. There are also a couple of outliers in the boxplot for those who have had a stroke (those with a morbidly obese BMI of around 45, which should drastically increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure -  all other factors that lead to a stroke), however, they do not drastically sway from the trend of the box plot. So more than their BMI, it seems like an individual’s age is a more influential factor in determining the susceptibility of an individual experiencing a stroke. \n",

    "Graph 7: \n",
    "This is a box plot that plotted the average glucose level distribution of the individuals who experienced or did not experience a stroke. On the x-axis, 0 indicates that the individuals have not suffered a stroke in the given time period and 1 indicates that they have experienced a stroke. The range of the average glucose level of those who have experienced a stroke is greater than those who did not experience a stroke. While this trend tracks alongside our previous observations (e.g., healthier individuals tend to have a more concentrated range of glucose levels, age could play a more influential factor, BMI could predispose certain individuals to develop other corroborating health issues), the sheer amount of outliers that span the graph from around 170 md/dl to 270 mg/dl is alarming. While there may be other factors that could corroborate this finding (e.g., testing done right after consumption of a meal, may face other health issues that could elevate their glucose level), it is intriguing that this much variability exists and yet they still did not experience a stroke. Maybe exploration into other factors, like stress, is pertinent to get a more holistic understanding and explanation of this phenomenon. \n",

    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "After thoroughly analyzing our findings derived from our predictive model and visualizations from the given datasets, we have uncovered fascinating insights surrounding complex elements that affect the risk of stroke. First of all, we noticed that our findings align with published research that women tend to have a higher incidence of stroke than men. The variability in the distribution of the age groups of women included in our dataset (spanning a high concentration from age 20 to 65) supports the above conclusion as a multitude of different factors like pregnancy, longevity, and consuming birth control medication amongst others, common amongst the range of women included in the dataset, could have caused this phenomenon to occur. Concerning males, we noticed that there was a higher concentration of individuals in the older age bracket, specifically in the age range of 40 to 70. While most of the graphs had an overall trend of having healthier participants concerning body mass index level and average glucose rate, we noticed that the body mass index for males in this data had the highest concentration around 25 to 35 (falling around the range of overweight to slightly obese in the normal weight classification for men). Men between the ages of 51 to 69 are typically more overweight than other age groups (due to becoming more susceptible to other corroborating diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc.), and there was a higher concentration of men within the age range of 40 to 70, making it a reasonable explanation for observing this trend. When we scrutinized the relationship stroke had with other corroborating factors like age, BMI, and average glucose level, we noticed that the age variable had a stronger correlation with the susceptibility to have a stroke in comparison to the other variables. Intriguingly, we noticed the higher variability in average glucose level and body mass index for those who did not experience a stroke in this time period in comparison to those who did led us to believe that there may be other unexplored factors that could have a larger role in determining what increased the susceptibility for stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we acknowledge potential shortcomings in our data analysis that may invite criticism. We noticed that our findings strayed from typical health narratives and research. Our visualizations provided intriguing insight that those who had heart disease, smoked, or had hypertension were less likely to experience a stroke than participants who did not have these conditions. While these are unexpected and contradictory patterns, it is important to note that we did not have access to other influential risk factors that may take precedence over these given conditions (i.e., family history, anxiety, depression, high stress levels, and/or other medical conditions like a tumor that could have a higher stake in the probability). Stroke etiology is complex and multifaceted - a finding that is supported by the multiple studies and secondary data sources we have cited throughout this paper. As risk is determined by a combination of genetics, lifestyle, and environment, our findings still hold value as they can be viewed as a review of a piece of a larger puzzle and not a comprehensive review. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, we recommend that a wider range of demographic groupings and health issues be included in a more diverse dataset for future studies. While this is out of the scope of our problem at hand, we believe it would make it possible to analyze the risk factors for stroke in a more representative manner across various groups. In addition, to further analyze the impact and relative risk of the variables, it would be pertinent if longitudinal data could be included. This could potentially alleviate the struggles we faced when analyzing our results and could provide a more dynamic perspective that could uncover other factors that lead to stroke. \n"
